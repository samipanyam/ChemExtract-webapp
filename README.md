# ChemExtract Frontend


## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.


# Running the Backend
either navigate to src and run 

```bash
flask run --app app
```

or pull the docker image from samipanyam/chemextract
and run it
